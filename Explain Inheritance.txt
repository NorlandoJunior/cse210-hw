Principle of Inheritance: 

Inheritance is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that allows a class 
(called a derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class 
(called a base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and makes it easier to maintain 
and extend programs. Instead of writing repeated code in multiple classes, developers can 
define common functionality once in the base class and allow other classes to reuse or 
override it as needed.

Benefits: 

inheritance is that it helps create a clear and organized structure for your program, 
reducing redundancy and improving scalability.

Application:

A good example is using a base class Vehicle and creating specific types like Car, 
Bicycle, and Motorcycle. All of them share behaviors such as Start() or Stop(), 
but each might implement them differently.

Example in code:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public class Vehicle
{
    public void Start() => Console.WriteLine("Vehicle starting...");
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public void Honk() => Console.WriteLine("Car honking!");
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

In this example, Car inherits the Start() method from Vehicle, so we donâ€™t need to 
redefine it. This makes the code more efficient and easier to maintain.
