Meaning:
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to hide the 
complex implementation details of a system and expose only the essential features to the user. In C#, 
abstraction is typically implemented using abstract classes or interfaces. This helps reduce complexity 
and allows the programmer to focus on the higher-level functionality without worrying about the internal 
workings of a system.

Benefits:
One of the key benefits of abstraction is code simplicity. By hiding the complexity, it makes the 
code more readable and easier to maintain. Developers can work with higher-level abstractions instead 
of dealing with intricate details. Additionally, abstraction allows for code reusability by providing a 
template that can be implemented in different ways without changing the structure.

Application:
For example, consider a class hierarchy where you have a Shape class with abstract methods like Draw(). 
Different types of shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle) can implement these abstract methods differently, but 
the user of the Shape class doesn't need to know the details. They can simply call Draw(), and the correct
method for the specific shape will be executed.

Code Example:
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw();  // Abstract method
}

// Derived class for a Circle
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

// Derived class for a Rectangle
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a Rectangle");
    }
}

// Using the abstract class
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Shape myShape = new Circle();  // Polymorphism in action
        myShape.Draw();  // Output: Drawing a Circle

        myShape = new Rectangle();  
        myShape.Draw();  // Output: Drawing a Rectangle
    }
}

Explanation:
In the above code, Shape is an abstract class that defines an abstract method Draw(). This method is then 
implemented by two derived classes, Circle and Rectangle, each providing its own implementation of Draw().
This allows for abstraction because the user of the Shape class does not need to know how the drawing is 
done internallyâ€”they just use the Draw() method, and the appropriate action is performed.
