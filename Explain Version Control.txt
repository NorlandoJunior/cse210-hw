Explaination Version Control

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing mutiple peolpe to collaborate
efficiently and ensuring that previous versions of project can be acessed if needed.It is essential in 
software devolpment because helps teams editing code, avoid conflicts, and maintain a history of modifications.

The benefit of version control is a mutual colaboration with a mutiple developers.
Mutiple developers can work in the same project but in different features simultaneously without overwriting
each outer's changes. If an issue arises, they can revert to a previous version of the code instead of starting over.

A good example a development team developers use a  Git to track a code changes. Each developers works on a separade
branch to implement new features. After the complete a code the developers can test a code with safety.

A commonly used Git command is:
bash
git commit -m "Added user authentication feature"
This command saves changes to the local repository with a descriptive message, making it easier to track modifications over time.
